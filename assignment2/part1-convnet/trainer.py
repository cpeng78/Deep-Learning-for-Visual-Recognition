        Optimize the parameters of a model to minimize a loss function. We use
        training data X and y to compute the loss and gradients, and periodically
        check the accuracy on the validation set.

        Inputs:
        - X: Array of training data; each X[i] is a training sample.
        - y: Vector of training labels; y[i] gives the label for X[i].
        - model: Model of ConvNet
        - learning_rate_decay: The learning rate is multiplied by this after each
          epoch.
        - sample_batches: If True, use a minibatch of data for each parameter update
          (stochastic gradient descent); if False, use the entire training set for
          each parameter update (gradient descent).
        - num_epochs: The number of epochs to take over the training data.
        - batch_size: The number of training samples to use at each iteration.
        - acc_frequency: If set to an integer, we compute the training and
          validation set error after every acc_frequency iterations.
        - verbose: If True, print status after each epoch.

        Returns a tuple of:
        - loss_history: List containing the value of the loss function at each
          iteration.
        - train_acc_history: List storing the training set accuracy at each epoch.
